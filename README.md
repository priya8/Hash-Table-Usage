HashTable-usage
===============
You are given a file (text file: in.txt) containing a list of 5000 names. Of these, several names occur multiple times. Give an efficient algorithm, that compresses the file size perhaps by removing the duplicates, and produces a new file (text file: out.txt). But some applications demand us to produce the original file using the output file, meaning, when given input as out.txt, the program should now produce in.txt as the output.
